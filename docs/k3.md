# Operation

The ELF file is located at `/u/cs452/tftp/ARM/ktverhoo/kernel3.elf` and can be
initiated using the typical `load` command.

The kernel should run the FirstUserTask and then exit printing usage statistics.


# Structure

## Implementation
Our implementation follows the same basic loop shown in class:

```c
int main(void) {
  initialize();
  while(true) {
    TaskDescriptor *td = schedule();

    if (!td) break;

    TaskRequest req = activate(td);
    handle(td, req);
  }
}

```

## Stack & Memory Layout
We implement our stacks growing downward in memory. The kernel stack begins in
the middle of the 32MB of memory and the user stacks start at the top of memory.

### User Stacks
The user stacks start at the top of memory and are each (for now) 1MB in size.
So each consequent user stack is 1MB separated in memory and therefore, there
can only be 16 active tasks. Of course, this number is arbitrary for now, and
will change once we deterimine the number of tasks needed for our kernel.

The memory layout is defined in `/include/kernel/kernel.h`. Here we define where
the kernel and user stacks begin and how large user stacks are.

## Task Descriptor
The task descriptor contains the following fields:

- `tid`: explained in the next section
- `sp`: user task stack pointer
- `psr`: user task status register
- `task`: pointer to function of task
- `parent`: pointer to parent task descriptor
- `next`: pointer to next task descriptor in priority queue
- `priority`: the tasks priority
- `ret`: the value to be returned to the task on syscall
- `sendq`: A circular buffer of size equal to the number of tasks

See: `include/task/task.h` for details.

## Task Identification

Tasks are uniquely indentified by tids which are tracked as unsigned 32-bit
integers. Every task has a unique tid, and currently all zombie tasks return
the tid upon exiting. The upper 16 bits of the tid represent a version number
and the lower 16 bits represent an id. All tids start at version 0.

For example, the tid `0x0000 0001` represents a task with id `1` and version
`0`.

See: `include/task/task.h` for details.

## TidTracker

The TidTracker is a distributer which distributes unique tids upon request. The
tids are pre-generated when the kernel starts running. Tids are re-used (with
an incremented version) when a task exits and the tid is returned to the
distributer for re-use. When the distributer runs out of tids, likely either
two things have happened:

- All tids are in use
- The use of a tid has exceeded $2^{16}$ re-issues in which an overflow may
  cause undefined behaviours

The TidTracker uses a circular buffer, prefilled with some maximum number of
tids allowed to be allocated to tasks at once. When a task is created, the
kernel requests a tid using `tt_get()` from the TidTracker. The tracker then
takes the first tid from the queue, pops it and gives it to the kernel. When
the task exits, the kernel calls `tt_return()` to return the tid to the tracker.
The tracker appends `1 << 16` to the tid, and inserts to the end of the buffer.

```c
int tid = tt_get(&tid_tracker);
tt_return(td->tid, &tid_tracker);
```

See: `include/task/task.h` for details.

The circular buffer is implemented using a fixed-sized array, with a start and
end index pointing to the head and tail of the queue respectively. The queue
has constant $O(1)$ time insertion as well as deletion of head. The circular
buffer itself does not have any overflow guards, however we rely on the limited
number of tids to ensure we never reach an overflow.

See `src/lib/circularBuffer/circularbuffer.c` for details.

## Context Switch

Instead of rephrasing the context switch, here is an annotated version of the
function `activate` which handles both the kernel to user and user to kernel
switches.

The activate function runs a set of inline assembly macros which perform the
saving of states to stacks, register manipulation, priviledge changes and jumps
to and from user land. 

### Kernel to User

```c
  if(td->it) {
    PUSH_STACK("r0-r12, lr");
    WRITE_SPSR(td->psr);
    
    SET_CPSR(SYSTEM_MODE);
    WRITE_SP(td->sp);
    POP_STACK("lr");
    asm("mov r8, sp");
    asm("add sp, sp, #56");

    SET_CPSR(KERNEL_MODE);
    asm("ldmfd r8, {r0-r12, lr}");
    asm("SUBS pc, lr, #4");
  }else{
    PUSH_STACK("r0-r12, lr");
    asm("mov r8, %0"::"r"(td->ret));
    PUSH_STACK("r8");
    WRITE_SPSR(td->psr);
    
    SET_CPSR(SYSTEM_MODE);
    WRITE_SP(td->sp);
    POP_STACK("lr");
    asm("mov r8, sp");
    asm("add sp, sp, #56");

    SET_CPSR(KERNEL_MODE);
    asm("ldmfd r8, {r0-r12, lr}");
    POP_STACK("r0");
    REVERSE_SWI();  
  }
```

### User to Kernel (on `IRQ` or `SWI`)

```c
  asm("IRQ_ENTRY:");
  asm("stmfd sp, {r0-r12};");

  asm("mov r9, sp;"
      "mov r10, lr;");

  SET_CPSR(SYSTEM_MODE);

  asm("ldmdb r9!, {r0-r7}");
  asm("stmdb sp!, {r0-r7, r10}");
  asm("ldmdb r9!, {r0-r4}");
  asm("stmdb sp!, {r0-r4}");
  PUSH_STACK("lr");

  SET_CPSR(KERNEL_MODE);
  POP_STACK("r0-r12");
  SET_CPSR(SYSTEM_MODE);
  READ_SP(td->sp);
  SET_CPSR(IRQ_MODE);
  READ_SPSR(td->psr);
  SET_CPSR(KERNEL_MODE);
  td->it = 1;

  asm("mov r0, #12"); //ENUM - TR_IRQ
  POP_STACK("lr");
  asm("b ACTIVATE_END");

  asm("KERNEL_ENTRY:");
  asm("stmfd sp, {r0-r12};");

  asm("mov r9, sp;"
      "mov r10, lr;");

  SET_CPSR(SYSTEM_MODE);

  asm("ldmdb r9!, {r0-r7}");
  asm("stmdb sp!, {r0-r7, r10}");
  asm("ldmdb r9!, {r0-r4}");
  asm("stmdb sp!, {r0-r4}");
  PUSH_STACK("lr");

  SET_CPSR(KERNEL_MODE);
  POP_STACK("r0-r12");
  SET_CPSR(SYSTEM_MODE);
  READ_SP(td->sp);
  SET_CPSR(KERNEL_MODE);
  READ_SPSR(td->psr);
  td->it = 0;
  SWI_ARG_FETCH("r0");
  POP_STACK("lr");

  asm("ACTIVATE_END:");
```

See `include/asm/asm.h` and `src/kernel/kernel.c` for details.

With our implementation of the context switch all three of the link registers
are saved and restored correctly.

### Limitations

#### Number of Mode Switches
As depicted above you can see that there are a number of changes in mode. This
could have potential performance issues and is probably an indicator that we
should refactor.

#### Switching Modes
Currently `SET_CPSR(MODE)` is dependent on the usage of a register, namely
`r12`. This means that when we re-enter the kernel, we must switch to system
mode to access the user stack pointer, corrupting `r12`.


## Scheduling
Scheduling is done by managing a set of task queues. There are 32 priorities and
hence 32 task queues. Tasks are placed in a task queue corresponding to its
priority. The next task that is scheduled is the one at the head of the highest
non-empty priority queue.

A 32-bit integer is used to maintain state information about which priority has
tasks available. When the $i$-th bit is flipped, them there are tasks available
in the priority $i$ queue.

Refer to `k1.pdf` for more information.

## Messaging

Messaging is done using `Send`, `Receive` and `Reply`. The implementations of
these is similar to as described in class and the notes.

### Send
`int Send(int tid, void *msg, int msg_len, void *reply, int reply_len);`

Sends a message to a receiver task `tid` by copying `msg` to the receivers
`msg`. If there is no receiver waiting, the sender is placed in the receiver's
`sendq` and blocked.

### Receive

`int Receive(int *tid, void *msg, int msg_len);`

Receives a message from a sender `*tid` into `msg`, or waits until there is one.


### Reply

`int Reply(int tid, void *reply, int reply_len);`

Meant to be called from a receiver to return results back to a sender. `reply`
is copied from the receiver to the sender.


### Note on Error Handling
Due to time limitations there is little to no error handling done around
messaging, besides asserts. It is in our backlog to implement error handling
for messaging.

## Name Server
The name server is implemented as a user task with a couple special system calls
which allow it to initialize with the kernel.

### RegisterNS
`int RegisterNS();`

Registers the calling task with the kernel as the nameserver.


### GetNS

`int GetNS();`

Returns the tid of the current nameserver registered with the kernel.

### Implementation
The Nameserver uses a basic `<int, int>` mapping from an integer name to a tid
with a fixed size array in O(1) time.

Tasks can register their own tid to a static integer name using `RegisterAs`.
Tasks can also query the tid of a static name from the nameserver using `WhoIs`.
Both are described in more detail below.

### RegisterAs

`int RegisterAs(int id);`

`RegisterAs` queries the tid of the registered NameServer using `GetNS`, then
calls the `Send` syscall with the nameserver tid and expects the NameServer to
return a success or failure on registering the user task into the nameserver.

### WhoIs
`int WhoIs(int id);` 

`WhoIs` queries the tid of the registed NameServer using `GetNS`, and calls the
`Send` syscall with the name server tid and expects the NameServer to return
the associated tid to the name.

## IRQ Context Switch

### Kernel To User Task

When activating a user task, the kernel now checks the TaskDescriptor interrupt
flag to determine if it is reloading a SWI or a hardware interrupted task. When
reloading an IRQ, all registers are restored and `SUBS pc, lr, #4` is
called.

### User Task to Kernel

The user state is first copied onto the irq stack and then migrated to the user
stack. The kernel state is then restored, and the SPSR is read from irq_mode. A
special flag is set in the user's TaskDescriptor to note that it has hardware
interrupted and should do a full restore (reload r0).

## Interrupt Handling

### Interrupt Handler

The Interrupt Handler supports the syscall `AwaitEvent` which user tasks
can invoke to block waiting for an interrupt and be awoken from the Interrupt
Matrix. The kernel will run the `event_register` command to register the
task on the interrupt specified by the user task's r0 (subsequently saved to
the user stack after context switch).

When a hardware interrupt occurs, the kernel enters via IRQ_mode, notes itself
as a hardware interrupt and then runs `event_wake` which does a lookup in
the Interrupt Matrix and wakes up all tasks blocking on the highest priority,
non-empty interrupt. Any active interrupts with higher priority (which have no
waiting tasks) will also be cleared to avoid multiple context switch overhead.

Interrupt initialization and cleanup are handled at the beginning and end of
the kernel. Interrupt init creates sets up the Interrupt Matrix, sets the IRQ
Mode stack base, and enables interrupts.

Interrupt cleanup diables all interrupts (so we don't have to reset the box
after every session).

Note: In the spirit of microkernels, enabling/disabling specific interrupts may
be moved to a user task instead.

```c
void init_irq(interrupt_matrix *im );
void cleanup_irq();
void event_register(interrupt_matrix *im, TaskDescriptor *td);
void event_wake(interrupt_matrix *im);
```

### Interrupt Matrix

The Interrupt Matrix is a data strcture which holds all tasks blocked waiting
on an interrupt. The matrix is a `struct` including circular buffers for
each interrupt the kernel handles (improve as we go). Currently, the Interrupt
Matrix only supports storing and loading tasks for the T3CUI interrupt.

Insertion and head deletion for the task both take $O(1)$ time. However, when
waking all tasks for a corresponding interrupt requires $O(n)$ time, for n being
the number of tasks waiting on the interrupt (rarely large).

```c
void im_init(interrupt_matrix *im);
int im_push(interrupt_matrix *im, TaskDescriptor *task, InterruptEvent ie);
TaskDescriptor *im_top(interrupt_matrix *im, InterruptEvent ie);
int im_pop(interrupt_matrix *im, InterruptEvent ie);
unsigned int im_eventsize(interrupt_matrix *im, InterruptEvent ie);
```

## Clock Server

### Event Types

- `Delay(tid, ticks)` - queues a task for the given number of ticks
- `DelayUntil(tid, tick)` - queues a task until the given tick
- `Update()` - tells the clock server to increase the tick count (meant to be
  sent from the clock server notifier)
- `Halt()` - tells the clock server to shut-down

### Implementation
The clock server is designed to be as simple as possible to minimize the chance
of bugs. Under the hood it is very simple. The clock server maintains an ordered
queue of task ids. The task ids are ordered based on the tick that the
task is waiting for. At the head of the linked-list is the task waiting for the
lowest tick. We prioritized the `pop` operation to be as fast as possible making
the trade-off of having a more expensive `insert` operation.

Insertion to the clock server queue occurs in $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of
elements in the queue.

Popping the next ready task id off of the queue is $O(1)$. Since the queue is
ordered no other adjustment has to occur when popping a task id.


The clock server itself is a typical send/receive server which loops infinitely
on a `Request` and handles the different events.

When the clock server receives an `Update` event it updates the tick count and
checks the queue for ready elements. Currently the clock server will pop off up
to `CS_PROCESS_NUM == 5` tasks per `Update`.

See `src/lib/clockserver_queue.c` `src/user/clockserver.c` for implementation
details.


### Clock Server Notifier
In order to notify the clock server of when an interrupt occurs, a separate task
is used to handle the interrupt and send a request to the clock server. The
clock server notifier calls `AwaitEvent` in an infinite loop and then `Send`s to
the clock server an `Update` request.




## Syscalls

The kernel supports the following syscalls:

- `Assert`: Invoked via `assert` provides a method of testing in tasks
- `Create`: Creates another task to be put on the kernel's task schedule
- `GetTid`: Get the task's tid
- `GetParentTid`: Get the parent's task tid
- `Pass`: Give control away
- `Exit`: Become a zombie
- `Send`: sends a message to a tid
- `Receive`: receives a message from another task
- `Reply`: replies to a sender with a result
- `RegisterNS`: Registers a user task as the nameserver
- `GetNS`: Returns the tid of the current nameserver

## Explanation

### User Tasks Output
First, you may notice the very terse output formatting. This is because having a
longer print statement actually delays tasks enough to mess with the ordering.

In our kernel, the larger the priority number, the more priority the task has.
31 is the highest priority and 0 is the lowest. The tasks are labeled `t6`
through `t9`. `t6` has priority 6 (highest), `t7` has priority 5, `t8` has
priority 4 and `t9` has priority 3.

To understand the correct ordering of the output we ran through the test case
by hand.  Consider the following timeline which demonstrates the ordering of
events worked out by hand, assuming the amount of time it takes between a task
resuming, printing and the next task delaying is less than a tick.

| time (ms) | event                            | output      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0         | t6 unblocked, delays for 100ms   |             |
| 0         | t7 unblocked, delays for 230ms   |             |
| 0         | t8 unblocked, delays for 330ms   |             |
| 0         | t9 unblocked, delays for 710ms   |             |
| 100       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i1   |
| 200       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i2   |
| 230       | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i1   |
| 300       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i3   |
| 330       | t8 resumes, prints, delays 330ms | t8,d33,i1   |
| 400       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i4   |
| 460       | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i2   |
| 500       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i5   |
| 600       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i6   |
| 660       | t8 resumes, prints, delays 330ms | t8,d33,i2   |
| 690       | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i3   |
| 700       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i7   |

| 800       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i8   |
| 900       | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i9   |
| 920       | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i4   |
| 990       | t8 resumes, prints, delays 330ms | t8,d33,i3   |
| 1000      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i10  |
| 1100      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i11  |
| 1150      | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i5   |
| 1200      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i12  |
| 1300      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i13  |
| 1320      | t8 resumes, prints, delays 330ms | t8,d33,i4   |
| 1380      | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i6   |
| 1400      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i14  |
| 1420      | t9 resumes, prints, delays 710ms | t9,d71,i2   |
| 1500      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i15  |
| 1600      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i16  |
| 1610      | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i7   |
| 1650      | t8 resumes, prints, delays 330ms | t8,d33,i5   |
| 1700      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i17  |
| 1800      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i18  |
| 1840      | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i8   |
| 1900      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i19  |
| 1980      | t8 resumes, prints, delays 330ms | t8,d33,i6   |
| 2000      | t6 resumes, prints, delays 100ms | t6,d10,i20  |
| 2070      | t7 resumes, prints, delays 230ms | t7,d23,i9   |
| 2130      | t9 resumes, prints, delays 710ms | t9,d71,i3   |

With the assumption that the time between a task resuming, printing and delaying
again is less than a tick, the above ordering holds. We noticed that increasing
the size of the print message caused some lines to be out of order. Namely,
`t7,d23,i3` and `t6,d10,i7` were out of order when we had a longer print
message for each line.

As you can see the output of the kernel matches the hand example.

### Metrics Output

### IdleTask 

The IdleTask serves the purpose of computing kernel metrics as well as a keep
alive for hardware interrupts to occur. 

The IdleTask measures its running time using the T3Timer and the ClockServer.
Every busy loop iteration, the IdleTask compares its last checked time against
the ClockServer to the current. If the tick values differ, then a hardware
interrupt must have occured. 

The IdleTask on every busy loop iteration performs a delta on the T3Timer. If
we've yet to be interrupted, sum the delta to the measured session. Once an
interupt has occured, sum the remaining delta (prev to 0) to session and sum
the session to total runtime. Once an interrupt occurs, the IdleTask asks the
IdleTaskInterface for permission to exit.

This method provides a finer granularity than ClockServer ticks as the IdleTask
will context switch in and out multiple times in one hardware interrupt. The
IdleTask has the ability to measure fractions of a tick using the 502KHz clock
(5020 cycles per tick).

Limitation: There will be a margin of error if the IdleTask is interrupted
between queries to the clock server. This will result in the IdleTask thinking
it has ran longer than it actually has. The margin of error will only ever be a
fraction of a tick, and corrects itself when the IdleTask realizes the
interrupt has occured.

Note: Running time metrics may be moved to the kernel in the future to provide
a more accurate and flexible measurement.

When IdleTask exits, it creates a ClockServerStop and NameServerStop task to
stop the ClockServer and NameServer respectively. The kernel will then
gracefully shutdown as no tasks exist.

###  IdleTaskInterface

The IdleTaskInterface serves as a gateway between the state of user tasks and
the IdleTask. Since the IdleTask cannot block (unless for a short query), the
IdleTaskInterface acts as a server listening to events happening in user land.

The first user task generates the IdleTaskInterface and sends a message about
the number of client tasks which should run.

The IdleTask will periodically query the IdleTaskInterface (once every irq) for
a request to exit. The IdleTaskInterface will reply `K3_NOT_FINISHED` unless
all client tasks have finished.

When client tasks complete, they notify the IdleTaskInterface of their exit.
Once all client tasks complete, IdleTaskInterface will respond to the next
IdleTask query with `K3_FINISHED`.
